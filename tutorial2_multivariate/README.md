## Tutorial 2: Step-by-step development of multivariate hhh4 models

This folder contains files for the second part of the tutorial, in which we will address multivariate hhh4 models.

- The materials in html format can be viewed [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/cmmid/hhh4-workshop/blob/main/tutorial2_multivariate/tutorial.html).
- All code chunks as a simple R file are available in  [tutorial.R](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cmmid/hhh4-workshop/main/tutorial2_multivariate/tutorial.R).
- The [data](https://github.com/cmmid/hhh4-workshop/tree/main/tutorial2_multivariate/data) folder contains two data sets in Rda format. These are also contained in the [hhh4addon](https://github.com/jbracher/hhh4addon) package, but provided here in case of difficulties installing the package.
